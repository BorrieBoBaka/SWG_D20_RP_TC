Officials investigated and claimed that the restaurant had a faulty fusion generator powering its kitchens, resulting in the fiery end of everyone inside. The restaurant, known as the Gallant Gualama Bistro, was known to host several members of the Coruscanti high life, and high ranking officials of the Empire. Among the casualties is HoloVid star Hiyene T'var, and Colonel Korvok Quiion of the 919th Imperial Regiment. Memorial services will be held at Imperial Palace at the end of the week. \n\nIn other news, the Imperial Council, at the behest of the Grand Vizier has begun to restrict unnecessary travel without a proper visa in and out of Coruscant for the time being. This paired with the current efforts with reinforcing outposts and bases along the core worlds and colonies is noted to be for the continued security of the people of the Empire. Many families have been overjoyed as more regiments are being consolidated and bringing soldiers close to home.",

We're a collection of journalists who have been fed up with the lack of free press since the fall of the Republic. The Rebel Alliance might be gone, but the galaxy still yearns for freedom, and we're here to keep the galaxy informed!\n\nOur first story to the galaxy live is a harrowing one. This is something the Empire is desperate to cover up. Word has spread that something horrible happened at Endor, beyond the defeat of the Rebel Alliance. We've sent scouts to the system to find debris and any sort of recording about what happened there, but what we have learned, and what they're not telling you, is that the Emperor is gone, and it's not on some unknown mission. The Empire was constructing a second Death Star battlestation, and it's missing. No debris, no trace.\n\nWorse yet? We're getting reports of planets around the Moddell Sector going dark and outright vanishing. Small fringer worlds with small populations. Mining worlds, and ordinance worlds. It's worse than we've feared, and the Empire keeps SILENT about this! Something is destroying these planets, and there's only one power in the Galaxy that can bring about that level of destruction! Is your world next? Is it the Empire's plans to snuff us out one by one? Why the secrecy?\n\nKeep your eyes in the sky and your starship engine running. Dark days are ahead, rebels. Spread the word, and keep your eyes, ears, or sensors out for our next broadcast.",
